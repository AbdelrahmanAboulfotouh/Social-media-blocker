## üõ†Ô∏è How to Customize (Block Other Sites)

To block any other site (e.g. TikTok, Reddit, Instagram), follow these steps:

### 1. Edit `manifest.json`

Update the `"host_permissions"` array to include the new sites:

```json
"host_permissions": [
  "*://*.facebook.com/*",
  "*://*.x.com/*",
  "*://*.reddit.com/*",         // example
  "*://*.tiktok.com/*"          // example
]
```

### 2. Edit `background.js`

Add a new blocking rule for each site you want to block:

```js
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateDynamicRules({
  addRules: [
    {
      id: 1,
      priority: 1,
      action: { type: "block" },
      condition: {
        urlFilter: "facebook.com",
        resourceTypes: ["main_frame"]
      }
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      priority: 1,
      action: { type: "block" },
      condition: {
        urlFilter: "x.com",
        resourceTypes: ["main_frame"]
      }
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      priority: 1,
      action: { type: "block" },
      condition: {
        urlFilter: "reddit.com",         // new block
        resourceTypes: ["main_frame"]
      }
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      priority: 1,
      action: { type: "block" },
      condition: {
        urlFilter: "tiktok.com",         // new block
        resourceTypes: ["main_frame"]
      }
    }
  ],
  removeRuleIds: [1, 2, 3, 4]
});
```

**Note**: Make sure each rule has a unique `id`.
